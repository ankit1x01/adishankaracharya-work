6) Explain the SYMBOLIC layer:
   - What the deity represents as a universal principle.
7) Explain the VEDANTIC layer:
   - What non-dual truth is being pointed to.
8) Explain the SADHANA layer:

9) Identify:
   - Which illusion is being dissolved.
   - Which truth is being installed.
10) Provide one-line essence.
11) Provide 3 reflection questions.
12) Provide a short practical exercise for daily life.

Tone: calm, precise, non-religious, experiential, and beginner-friendly.
Avoid superstition. Avoid blind belief. Focus on realization and inner transformation.

If possible, compare this verse with a similar idea from Upanishads or Advaita texts and briefly show the connection.
