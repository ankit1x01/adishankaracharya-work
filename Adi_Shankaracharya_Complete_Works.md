## Introduction

**Adi Shankaracharya** (आदि शङ्कराचार्य), also known as **Adi Shankara**, was an 8th-century Indian philosopher and theologian who systematized the philosophy of **Advaita Vedanta**. In his short lifespan of 32 years, he produced an extraordinary body of work that includes:

- **Bhashyas** (commentaries) on the foundational texts of Vedanta
- **Prakarana Granthas** (independent philosophical treatises)
- **Stotras** (devotional hymns)

His works emphasize the fundamental unity of the individual soul (**Atman**) with the universal consciousness (**Brahman**), stating: **"Brahma Satyam Jagat Mithya, Jivo Brahmaiva Na Aparah"** (Brahman alone is real, the world is illusory, the individual soul is none other than Brahman).

## Core Philosophical Concepts

### Advaita Vedanta: The Non-Dual Philosophy

#### The Central Teaching

**"Brahma Satyam Jagat Mithya, Jivo Brahmaiva Na Aparah"**
_Brahman alone is real, the world is illusory (appearance), the individual soul is not different from Brahman_

#### Key Concepts

**1. Brahman**

- The ultimate, infinite, unchanging reality
- **Nirguna Brahman**: Without attributes, formless
- **Saguna Brahman**: With attributes, personal God (Ishvara)
- Existence-Consciousness-Bliss (Sat-Chit-Ananda)

**2. Atman**

- The individual Self/Soul
- Identical with Brahman
- Pure consciousness, eternal, unchanging

**3. Maya**

- Cosmic illusion/appearance
- Power of Brahman that projects the universe
- Neither real nor unreal (_anirvachaniya_)
- Causes the appearance of multiplicity

**4. Avidya (Ignorance)**

- Individual ignorance
- Root cause of suffering
- Removed only by knowledge (_Jnana_)

**5. Moksha (Liberation)**

- Realization of one's true nature as Brahman
- Freedom from cycle of birth and death
- Not a state to be achieved but reality to be realized
- Can be attained in this life (_Jivanmukti_)

#### The Four Mahavakyas (Great Sentences)

These aphorisms from the Upanishads encapsulate Advaita:

1. **"Prajnanam Brahma"** (प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म)
   - "Consciousness is Brahman"
   - From Aitareya Upanishad (Rig Veda)

3. **Pratibhasika Satta** (Apparent Reality)

#### Paths to Liberation

While knowledge (_Jnana_) is the direct means, Shankara acknowledges preparatory paths:

2. **Bhakti Yoga**: Devotion to prepare the heart
3. **Jnana Yoga**: Direct knowledge of the Self (ultimate path)

व्यये कृते वर्धत एव नित्यं विद्याधनं सर्वधनप्रधानम् ॥"**

_"[Knowledge] cannot be stolen by thieves, nor can it be taken away by kings. It cannot be divided among brothers, nor is it heavy to carry. If spent daily, it indeed always keeps growing. The wealth of knowledge is the most superior of all wealth."_
